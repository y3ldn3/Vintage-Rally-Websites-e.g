            <p class="information_paragraph">In the Sports Car Club of the World, VintageRally is the most popular and easily accessible extreme dirt motorsport, making it the ideal venue for determining whether you have what it takes to powerslide your way to victory. Imagine a scaled-down rally stage being set up on a patch of unpaved ground, with traffic cones used to mark the route instead of trees or rocks. In most regions, all that is required is to show up at event registration with a sound, hardtop vehicle and the entry fee because the entry fees and equipment requirements are significantly lower than those needed to enter any other kind of performance rally. Many SCCA Regions loan out helmets and will help a new competitor with registration.</p>
