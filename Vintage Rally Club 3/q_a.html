            <h2>Questions Frequently Asked</h2>
            <h3>What Does Every Rally Car Need</h3>
            <p class="answer_paragraph">The regulations for Rally are designed to keep the vehicles as near to what can be constructed and operated legally on public roads. The main snag is being able to drive on public roads. Rally automobiles MUST meet the same requirements as other cars, including passing emissions tests, having valid registration, and carrying legal insurance.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>What Makes A Rally Car A Rally Car</h3>
            <p class="answer_paragraph">Rally vehicles need to be robust, nimble, and adaptable. A rally stage is made out of dips, big boulders, and jumps while regular race cars compete on flat, even race tracks. As a result, rally cars need a number of improvements to keep them from breaking while competing.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Do Rally Cars Have A Clutch</h3>
            <p class="answer_paragraph">It is sequential because you cannot shift from first to fifth in a single gear change because the drum can only revolve one click at a time. The clutch is still required to start and stop the transmission because it operates in the same way that any manually driven clutch transmission would.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Why Are Rally Cars Loud</h3>
            <p class="answer_paragraph">Rally cars sound amazing because of a general lack of traction. Drivers compensate for weaker grip in low-speed corners by applying more throttle, and the resulting cacophony is rapidly enticing in pretty much any rally vehicle, from the Porsche 911 to the Lancia Stratos.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>What Suspension does a rally car use</h3>
            <p class="answer_paragraph">A rally car's shock absorbers are made up of two components: a spring and a damper.</p>
