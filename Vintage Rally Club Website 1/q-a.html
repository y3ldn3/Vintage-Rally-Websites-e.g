                <p class="paragraph-information">The rally world was stunned by the little car. It could easily produce 550 horsepower thanks to its enormous back wing,
                    all-wheel-drive system, and 4-cylinder engine. This World Rally Championship beast had a mid-ship engine and belonged to Group B. In 1985 and
                    1986, the T16 machine was victorious. It may have continued to dominate the WRC if the Group B cars had not been banned. The vehicle stayed in
                    motorsport after that, competing in the Paris-Dakar races until the late 1980s.</p>

                <br>
                <p class="paragraph-information">In all of motoring, a co-driver is the most vital navigation system. It's impossible to memorize every turn of every route 
                    in the rally, unlike racing circuits, when drivers memorize every corner and repeat the bends lap after lap. However, the stakes are significantly bigger
                    than in road racing. Your car could be sliding down a mountainside if you slide on one turn. A fall like this might cause irreversible harm, not to mention 
                    the possibility of injuries.   So, in the passenger seat, a co-driver directs the driver during the rally. The co-driver makes notes at each stage and informs
                    the driver about the corner's direction, severity, and any straightaways in between bends..</p>

                <h3 class="header-h3">Can Fans Attend Rallys</h3>
                <br>
                <p class="paragraph-information">Yes! Fortunately, fans can attend World Rally Championship events to get up close and personal with the vehicles. Seeing people
                    lining the track at what appears to be a perilous distance is not uncommon.  Tickets that guarantee entrance to specific stages of an event can be purchased.
                    You'll watch one stage before joining the rally for the next one. This is usually a short walk or drive away, and following the pack on the road makes for an 
                    interesting trip. Hospitality packages are also available, which include entrance to a lounge where you can meet other WRC fans.

                <p class="paragraph-information">This vehicle was developed by the Citroën team to compete in the World Rally Championship series. It perfectly replaced the Xsara
                    on the track. The basis of this car was an ordinary hatchback. The Citroën C4 WRC is a modern legend. The greatest rally racer of all time, Sebastien Loeb,
                    has sealed a crushing victory with this car from 2007 to 2010 and has won 13 asphalt rounds of the rally championship.</p>
